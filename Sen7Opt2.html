		<h1>Assigning to Self</h1>

		<p>Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.</p>
    <p>Never underestimate the importance of assigning items to "self." The Planning process should include a focus not only on what
    providers can offer, but also should place some focus on personal accountability as well. For a number of years now direct care
    in this field has been switching philophies away from "do for me" to "teach me to do." It is important that when coordinating care
    we also make that shift in views. Individuals involvement in their own care planning needs to be more than simply giving their 
    opinions on what they want. We need to also be empowering people to help themselves meeth their goals.
