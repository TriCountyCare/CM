		<p>In fact, all the options listed require this form to be filled out. Currently, under the core health home function of 
    "Comprehensive Transitional Care" our agency meets the requirement of <strong> "a systematic follow-up protocol in place to assure 
    timely access to follow-up care post discharge that includes a minimum receipt of a summary carer ecord from the discharging 
    entity, medicaiton reconciliation, timely scheduled appointments at recommended outpatient providers, care manager verification 
    with outpatient provider that the patient attended the appointment and a plan to outreach and re-engagege the patient in care 
    if the appointment was missed."</strong>  Additionally this also how we meet the need for <strong>"Policies and procedures in place with local 
    practitioners, health facilities including emergency rooms, hospitals, and residential/rehabiliataion settings, providers and 
    community-based services to help ensure coordinated, safe transitions in care for its patients who require transfers in the 
    site of care.</strong> There are two other areas under Comprehensive Transitional Care that Care Managers should be aware of, because 
    they are coming as the technology continues to develop and eventually becomes available. The first is <strong> "A system in place with 
    hospitals and residential/rehabilitation facilities in their network to provide the health home prompt notification of an 
    individual's admission and/or discharge to/from an emergency room, inpatient, or residential/rehabilitation setting"</strong> and the 
    other is <strong>"Utilizing HIT as feasible to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration among all providers, the patient, family, 
    care givers, and slocal supports."</strong> While HIXNY and not yet opporatnig in the ways necessary with CCOs to fully meet those 
    requirements, Care Managers should be familiarizing themselves with these concepts, and working to the best of their ability 
    to be a pivot point amongst the team and encouraging consistent communication as necessary to meet the needs of the individuals 
    with what technology we can currently access, even if that is simply email and/or phone calls at the moment.
