		<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 3</strong></h1>

		<p><font size=4>An individual that you support lives at a community residence. You go there regularly to conduct face-to-face visits, at the
                    individual's request. You're very familiar with the house manager and the staff, and you have a great relationship with all
                    of them. They're all friendly people and it's evident how much they care for the individuals in the house. While there
                    for a visit, you ask about the dance party that was the night before. She states that she didn't attend the party because
                    there weren't enough staff. This had been an issue in the past and you had become creative and worked with the reidence
                    director in that agency to arrange to have another house in the agency transport her. You ask if the other house didn't
                    go either and she becomes quiet. When you ask again for more information she explains that she couldn't go because they
                    needed her in the house to help out. The other individuals in the house do not function as strongly as this individual
                    does. You ask what she means by needing her to help out. She explains that she had to watch Charlie, who is Line-of-site,
                    while staff did showers for the others in the home, because there weren't enough staff. You talk to the house manager for
                    more information. The house manager is clearly distressed and tells you all about their staffing issues and how her supervisor
                    tells her to "figure it out" or she won't have a job. You feel bad for the situation this woman is in, because it is clear
                    she is trying her best with her limited resources. You...</font>.</p>

             	   <li><a href="Sen3Option1.html"><img src="Option1.jpg"> </a> <font size=5>Explain that this is unacceptable and that you
                 don't want this individual to be left in that situation again. It is not fair that she should be missing out on her activities
                 to do work that is not hers, and if something had happened to Charlie while she was watching him it would have been unsafe
                 for him and unfair to her to have such pressure. You speak firmly and explain that you will be checking in regularly to ensure
                 that this doesn't happen again.</li>

		   <li><a href="Sen3Option2.html"><img src="Option2.JPG"> </a> Contact the residential director that you had been in contact with the last 
       time. Explain that you understand that staffing has been short lately, and ask to come up with other ideas. You successfully worked together
       in the past to find a creative way to get Lilly to her Dance before, and are confident that you two could brainstorm creative ways
       for different houses to work together to help cover such scenarios. </li>
