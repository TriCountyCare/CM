			<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 7</strong></h1>

				<p><font size=4>Let's take a moment to step back and look at the big picture, which is easy to lose given
						the complicated nature of Care Management. You meet with someone "To complete their IAM assessment."
                                                Is that really the case, though? In fact, you're meeting with the individual to identify their 
						strengths, needs, hopes, and dreams. We are helping them <i>plan</i> their <i>lives</i>. The IAM
						assessment that you use is simply a tool.
						<p>In your meeting they identify what they want to accomplish in life. You ask them what they need
						in order to accomplish it. What they want to accomplish becomes their <i>Goal or valued outcome.</i>
						What they need to accomplish it is the <i>provider assigned goal/action step.</i>
						<p>Who takes on these goals? Day habs, residences, com hab, vocational programs, etc. The thing that
						is often missing however, is <i>individual involvement</i>.
						<p>People tend to be much more successful when they themselves are involved in their own care and 
						their own goals. The concent of <strong>Person Centered Planning</strong> has been around for a very
						long time, however we need to move toward <strong>Person Inclusive Planning</strong>. So what is the
						difference? Simply "centering around" what the person wants is a great  start, but we need to do more
						to include them than simply asking them what they want to accomplish. We need to insure that they have an 
						<i>active</i>role in their goals as well. Let's talk about the ways we can we can move from PCP to PIP.
