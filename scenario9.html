				she supports, and has wonderful relationships with their teams. Mary Ellen has worked with many of these families for
				years as an MSC prior to the 7/1/18 conversion to Care Management. She has a knack for finding the right programs and 
				services for the people she serves. Mary Ellen is a walking database of not only waiver services but community supports
				and her coworkers rely upon her heavily for information. She is an asset to her office. But....
    <ol>
				<li>The extent of Mary Ellen's use of medisked is writing case notes.</li>
				<li>She does not update medisked for hospitalizations, changes of adress, to add email adresses, etc.</li>
				<li>Her Life Plans, while looking wonderful in the narratives, do not list providers or non-waiver services.</li
				<li>After more than a year in Care Management, Mary Ellen is severely falling behind the curve.</li>	   

    </ol>
				<p>When Mary Ellen is asked about these concerns, she states that her priority is the individuals she serves</p>
				<p>How is her logic flawed? Identify ways that Mary Ellen's clients can/will be negatively impacted by her shortcomings.</p>
