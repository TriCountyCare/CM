			<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 8</strong></h1>

				<p><font size=4>You serve many different types of people in Care Management. Some are heavily involved
				in waiver services, and others have none. Some want more and are waiting for available spots, others want
				less and are looking for alternatives. We focus a lot on waiver services in Care Management and in many
				ways it seems to be the "bread and butter" of what we do, so to speak.
				<p>When it comes to providing services, however there are so many things available that are not waiver
				related at all. It's important to ask yourself
    <ol>
				<li>Are individuals/families connected to local supports such as food pantries, social groups, and health fairs?</li>
				<li>Are individuals/families connected to larger social supports such as housing programs, food stamps, and HEAP?</li>
				<li>Have <i>you</i> taken the time to learn about services available in your area?
				<li>If you are doing a great job identifying and connecting individuals to non-waiver services - are you reflecting 
				    those services in the Life Plan?</li>	   

    </ol>
				<p>If you're doing the work, make sure you're getting the credit!</p>
				<p>Let's break into groups a brainstorm some <i>local</i> and <i>larger</i> social programs that are often missed.
