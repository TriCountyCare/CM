			<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 5</strong></h1>
				<p><font size=4>What level of involvement should a care manager have regarding health promotion for each of the following individuals:
    <ol>
	    <li>Cera lives at home with her family. She has not been to see a doctor of any type in years. Her family is not native to this country and seems dismissive 
                of such appointments – preventative care was not something that they are used to and they don’t seem to see the value in it. Cera’s intellectual level does 
                not allow her to fully understand the benefits/risks of not attending preventative care meetings. She cannot go to an appointment without support for both 
                transportation and comprehension during appointments. </li>
	    <li>Bill lives in a community residence. He has missed many appointments due to “refusing” them. House staff state that it is his right to refuse appointments, but 
                the Care Manager feels that the house staff uses that as an excuse to not have to take him, and are not doing their due diligence to encourage these appointments.</li>
	    <li>Kenzi lives on her own. The care manager can observe when speaking to her that her teeth are rotting. She rarely sees a doctor and has never seen a dentist. Kenzi 
                has two young children and takes the bus/walks to places she wants to be, including educational appointments for her 3 year old. Kenzi is overweight and smokes a lot. 
                She wants a job but never seems to get called back after interviews. When asked about preventative appointments she shrugs.</li>
