		<p> A week later you come in in the morning to find two voicemails. The first is a a notification of an incident 
		where your individual was hurt when another housemate. It is reported that the individual was left by staff to 
		supervisor this housemate, and in an attempt to keep the housemate from harming themself she ended up hit by the 
		individual. The second voicemail is from the incident investigator. She asks you to call her back stating that
		she would like to know if you have any knowledge of the individual being left to supervisor others in the past.</p>
