		<h1>The Importance of Peer Interactions to Empower an Individual</h1>

    <p>Have you ever saught out a support group (in person or on the web) to help you through situations in your life? Weight loss, 
    grief, divorce, illnesses - they exist for many things, and many people find themselves utilizing them. Even if you have not actively 
    used a support group, you have likely experienced a time in your life where you have felt comfort knowing that someone else you know
    has been through a similar experience. 
    <p>The individuals we serve and their  families often lack the resources to seek out others in their situaitons. They can feel socially isolated. Families can benefit
    from support groups ranging from groups for parents raising a special needs child to groups for children who often feel underacknowledged
    because of their special-needs siblings. Individuals themselves can benefit from groups that may make them feel they are not alone either 
    regarding their ID/DD idagnosis or co-occuring health/mental health diagnosis that they may receive. As a Care Manager, don't underestimate 
    the impact that providing a listing of such groups can have for individuals and their families.
