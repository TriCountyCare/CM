		<h1><strong> You Selected Option 2</strong></h1>
		<p>Your client tells you that she has been depressed and hasn't had the motivation to do anything lately. You discuss reasons she may be depressed and offer to help her set up counseling as well as suggesting an appointment with her primary doctor for further guidance. You ask if she feels her depression has gotten in the way of her doing daily tasks, such as laundry and she agrees. You discuss that you are concerned with the apartment because you want her to be healthy, and discuss ways to improve the situation. She seems relieved to have someone helping her.</p>
