		<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 1</strong></h1>
		<p><font size=4>You set up a face to face meeting for an individual. They requested that you come to their home, so you do so. You notice while there that the home is in poor condition. There are dishes all over the home with spoiled food, the carpets are filthy, there is laundry everywhere, and the home smells of urine. The individual seems oblivious to the conditions and offers you a glass of water</font>.</p>
		<ul>
             	   <li><a href="Sen1Option1.html"><img src="Option1.jpg"></a> <font size=5> Ask the individual what happened and if it is normally like this</li>
		   <li><a href="Sen1Option2.html"><img src="Option2.jpg"> </a> Explain that you are concerned with the condition of the home.</li>
		   <li><a href="Sen1Option3.html"><img src="Option3.jpg"> </a> Continue observing and engage in normal conversation to see if an opportunity presents itself to discuss your concerns.</font></li>
