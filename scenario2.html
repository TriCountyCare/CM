		<h1><strong>Comprehensive Care Management Scenario 2</strong></h1>
		<p><font size=4>Last week you held a Life Plan meeting for an individual you serve. The individual, family, and providers were all in agreement with the goals 
				and services discussed in the meeting. Since that time you have updated the plan in the medisked to reflect those discussions and sent the revised 
				draft for acknowledgement. The community habilitation provider calls you after receiving the plan and requests changes. How do you respond?</font>.</p>
		<ul>
             	   <li><a href="Sen2Option1.html"><img src="Option1.jpg"> </a> <font size=5> Politely explain that you won't be making any changes because they had already agreed
                                to the plan at the time of the meeting.</li>
		   <li><a href="Sen2Option2.html"><img src="Option2.JPG"> </a> Ask what sort of changes they wanted to make.</li>
		   <li><a href="Sen2Option3.html"><img src="Option3.JPG"> </a> Explain to the provider that you will happily make any changes they need, and ask them to email 
									   you the changes that they require.</font></li>
